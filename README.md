# How to use it  
The big entry box called (Mensagem para spam) is where you input the message that you want to spam  
  
The small entry box called (Quantidade) is where you input how many messages you want to send, use only numbers or something happens, never tested it :)  
  
Press the button (Raja!) after you inserted the message that you want to spam and the quantity, it will a countdown 
  
The green number is the countdown timer that counts from 5 to 0 after you press the (Raja!) button, you wil want to place your mouse in the whatsapp web message bar before the timer ends
  
# Disclaimer
RajaZap5.0 is my first program with a proper GUI  
The code is a complete mess, i will for sure try to improve on that  
I will try to make the next version on PyQT6  
I accept any tips about how to make the code cleaner
